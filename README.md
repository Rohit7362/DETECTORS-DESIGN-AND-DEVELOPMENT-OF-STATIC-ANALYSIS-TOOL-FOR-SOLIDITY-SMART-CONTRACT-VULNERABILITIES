MY FINAL YEAR PROJECT "DETECTORS": DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF STATIC ANALYSIS TOOL FOR SOLIDITY SMART CONTRACT VULNERABILITIES USING JAVASCRIPT.
My tool provides an efficient way to automatically detect and correct critical vulnerabilities like Reentrancy, Integer Overflows/Underflows, and Denial of Service (DoS) in Solidity smart contracts.Evaluated tools like Oyente, Slither, and Solhint using 100 smart contracts, then developed an in-house analyzer to improve detection accuracy. The tool provides terminal reports, auto-corrects code, and generates a secure .sol output for safer deployment.


My Tool Can Do:-
Reentrancy is handled by inserting a locking modifier, Integer bugs are fixed using Solidity’s unchecked {} syntax for safety , Denial of Service (DoS) risks are not auto inline warnings fixed but clearly flagged with.
